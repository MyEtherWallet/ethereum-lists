A repository for maintaining lists of things like malicious URLs, fake token addresses, and so forth. We love lists.

## Found a Phishing URL? See a fake ICO address?

2. Navigate to the `src` folder and pick which one you'd like to add:

   - `addresses` folder is for the darklisting or whitelisting ethereum addresses
   - `contracts` folder is for the different network contracts
